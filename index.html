        I am a rising second year CSE PhD student, advised by Dr. William Griswold at the University of California, San Diego. 
        My research interest areas include Software Engineering and Human-Computer Interaction. 
        I graduated with a BA in Computer Science from New College of Florida in 2018.
        On this page I've gathered my current and past research projects and detailed relevant opportunities and adventures.

            During this quarter I will be the TA for CSE 210 Software Engineering, taught by Dr. William Griswold. 
            This graduate-level course takes students through a quarter-long software project with a real client using Agile developement methodology. 
            Each week research papers are read and discussed, along with chapters from <i>Head First Software Development</i> and <i>The Mythical Man Month</i>.

            I was a student volunteer at the 2019 ESRI User Conference in San Diego, California.
            The group of us student volunteers were very diverse in our disciplindes, ranging from Geography to Biology to History. 
            It was clear that we all offered different appreciations for GIS that I enjoyed to learn about. 
            I would recommend this experience to anyone seeking more ways to discover GIS and make connections within the community!
