        I am a third year CSE PhD student, advised by William Griswold at the University of California, San Diego. 
        My research interests include Software Engineering, Human-Computer Interaction, and GIS. 
        I graduated with a BA in Computer Science from New College of Florida in 2018.

            During this quarter I will be the TA for CSE 210 Software Engineering, taught by Dr. William Griswold. 
            This graduate-level course takes students through a quarter-long software project with a real client using Agile developement methodology. 
            Each week research papers are read and discussed, along with chapters from <i>Head First Software Development</i> and <i>The Mythical Man Month</i>.

            I was a student volunteer at the 2019 ESRI User Conference in San Diego, California.
            The group of us student volunteers were very diverse in our disciplindes, ranging from Geography to Biology to History. 
            It was clear that we all offered different appreciations for GIS that I enjoyed to learn about. 
            I would recommend this experience to anyone seeking more ways to discover GIS and make connections within the community!

        <p>Invariants Plugin, Winter 2019-Present
        </br >
        IntelliJ plugin that displays invariant properties and their changes at the method level. I am developing a user study to evaluate the usefulness of invariants in debugging. With Massimiliano Menarini, led by William Griswold.</p>
        <p>Synthesis of Layout Constraints, Fall 2018-Present
        </br >
        An interactive constraint-based layout tool for synthesizing generalizable layouts from few examples. I am developing the UI for our tool as part of a case study. With Dylan Lukes and John Sarracino, led by Nadia Polikarpova and Sorin Lerner.</p>
