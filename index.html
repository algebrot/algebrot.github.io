        I am a third year CSE PhD student, advised by William Griswold at the University of California, San Diego. 
        My research interests include Software Engineering, Human-Computer Interaction, and GIS. 
        I graduated with a BA in Computer Science from New College of Florida in 2018.

            During this winter quarter I was a TA for CSE 110 Software Engineering, taught by Dr. William Griswold. 
            This undergraduate-level course involves a quarter-long implementation of an Android application using Agile development methodology. 
            I organized and graded in-class quizzes and held lab hours.

            During this fall quarter I was the TA for CSE 210 Software Engineering, taught by Dr. William Griswold. 
            This graduate-level course involves a quarter-long software project with a real client using Agile developement methodology. 
             I facilitated in-class discussion groups, graded reading assignments, and held office hours.

            I was a student volunteer at the 2019 ESRI User Conference in San Diego, California.
            The group of us student volunteers were very diverse in our disciplindes, ranging from Geography to Biology to History. 
            It was clear that we all offered different appreciations for GIS that I enjoyed to learn about. 
            I would recommend this experience to anyone seeking more ways to discover GIS and make connections within the community!
